My first PCB was very simple and I won't mention it here (Ted knows). I'm much more proud of my second PCB, which implemented the motherboard in a distributed Battery Management System. For prototyping purposes, we had developed a separate breakout board with our STM32 and CAN drivers and whatnot, which left me with a very large chunk of blank space that would be nominally obscured by the breakout board. I thus decided to leave a small handdrawn silkscreen easter egg.

The next work that I produced was inspired by our first Formula Electric at Berkeley President, who showed me his laser cut and engraved personalized aluminum business cards when we were at Jacobs Makerspace. Almost a whole year later, another Formula friend of mine mentioned at Mezzo's how it would be a great idea to use NFC tags to store resumes. From that idea it would take another year before version 1 of my PCB business cards would be created, meant as a gift / stay-in-touch memento for my colleages at Tesla and Molex (indeed anyone who visits DC 26L will have a slight chance of encountering one).

This board, manufactured in black solder mask and ENIG, is a good demonstrator of utility (providing common footprints, trace sizes, and a ruler in metric and imperial) as well as a graphic depiction of our Formula car. This also pushed the manufacturing limits as well, which is why I won't be using PCBWay ever again. Fortunately, since solder mask and copper manufacturing is directly tied to the functionality of a PCB, we can usually rely on those to remain aesthetically consistent and not fuzzy. The front side displays a (painstakingly) manually routed NFC antenna, tuned according to the ST NFC tag's internal tuning capacitance. Current implementations embed a LinkedIn connection link, although previous versions directed users to the Menchie's in Northside Berkeley that I frequent very often. The tag is great in its power harvesting ability, which eliminates need for a battery and allows for a status indicator LED to light up to visually display functionality.

Before I move onto the final most recent work, I want to showcase some other inspirations. This is version 2 (?) of NVIDIA's PCB rulers, which I acquired while visiting their HQ. It differs than the usual ruler sparingly handed out at the annual Berkeley recruiting event in that it only uses ENIG and no silkscreen, ensuring everything looks consistent and nice. The combination of traces and BGA pads got me thinking about pushing features even smaller. From my time at the Awty school yearbook, I knew that halftoning could be a good way of representing different shades of color, so I took on the goal of representing something special with just a black and white image and the magic of Photoshop.

Here is a product I'm really proud of, gifted to members of the Silicon Engineering team at Starlink / SpaceX for putting up with me for a summer (as well as many interns). This picture I took while in Mount Rainier National Park, where the background was removed, the picture transformed into greyscale, and halftoned to represent shadows as differently sized pixels. The fidelity of the solder mask art is excellent as the smallest pixel size is 8 / 8 mils, well above the 4 / 4 mils JLCPCB advertises (although I've accidentally gone smaller on some of the PCB business card designs). A prior image was ruined by a Starlink satelite's orbit, so I decided to represent the entire constellation and stars in silkscreen (which is visibly blurry). 

Much of this blog is adapted from my lecture for Berkeley IEEE's DeCal, Hands On PCB Engineering (EE 198). A future blog will showcase an even greater improvement in color representation, where I managed to reduce a single image to 3 shades of color instead of 2, all using the open source KiCAD instead of Altium (which would come back to haunt me later). 

Thanks for reading. Please let me know if you've come across one of these in the wild and any aesthetic improvements I can make!
