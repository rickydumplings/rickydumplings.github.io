Welcome to my personal webpage!

I've had quite the unique journey so far; I started off as a mechanical engineer and switched into EECS the day before Junior year started, I've taught the HOPE PCB DeCal, and I was one of the first members of Formula Electric at Berkeley. But, if you're on this page, you probably have access to my LinkedIn anyways. 

This is a space where I want to highlight some of my accomplishments and thoughts that aren't exactly relevant for my network / have some useful insights that I feel are best made public. Enjoy, and if you have any questions, shoot me a LinkedIn message. -->
